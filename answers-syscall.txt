1. Looking at the backtrace output, which function called syscall? 
`kernel/trap.c` 67

2. What is the value of p->trapframe->a7 and what does that value represent? (Hint: look user/initcode.S, the first user program xv6 starts.)
7, meaning SYS_exec

3. What was the previous mode that the CPU was in? 
user mode (SPP bit == 0)

4. Write down the assembly instruction the kernel is panicing at. Which register corresponds to the variable num? 
    80002054:	00002683          	lw	a3,0(zero) # 0 <_entry-0x80000000>

5. Why does the kernel crash?
risc-v mem address starts from 0x0C000000, so 0x0 is not mapped
and it's confirmed by scause 0x000000000000000d

6. What is the name of the binary that was running when the kernel paniced? What is its process id (pid)? 
initcode, 1
